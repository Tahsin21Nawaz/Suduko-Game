Features -
Input Grid: A 9x9 grid for users to input Sudoku values (1-9) or leave cells blank for unknown values.
Validation: Ensures rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids contain unique values.
Solve Button: Uses a backtracking algorithm to find solutions for valid puzzles.
UI: Clean and responsive interface for easy interaction.


Approach
The application is built in React for a dynamic, interactive UI. The core components and logic are implemented as follows:
Grid Component: Renders a 9x9 input grid, where each cell can take numbers from 1-9.
Validation: Before solving, the app checks for any duplicate values in rows, columns, and sub-grids.
Backtracking Algorithm: Implements a recursive function to attempt filling the grid according to Sudoku rules.


Validation Logic
The validation function checks the current state of the grid to ensure it follows these rules:
Row Uniqueness: Each row must have unique values from 1-9.
Column Uniqueness: Each column must have unique values from 1-9.
3x3 Sub-grid Uniqueness: Each 3x3 sub-grid must have unique values from 1-9.


Solving Algorithm
The solving function employs a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle:
Find Empty Cells: Identifies the first empty cell in the grid.
Attempt to Place Values: Tries each number (1-9) in the empty cell and checks if it passes the validation rules.
Recursive Backtracking: If placing a number is valid, the function proceeds to the next empty cell. If no valid number can be placed, it backtracks to the previous cell to try a different number.
Solution Found: The process repeats until the entire grid is filled, providing a solution to the puzzle.


Usage
Input a Sudoku Puzzle: Enter the known numbers in the grid, leaving unknown cells blank.
Validate: Click the Validate button to ensure the puzzle is valid.
Solve: If the puzzle is valid, click Solve to see the solution.
Reset: Use the Reset button to clear the grid and start a new puzzle.
